Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note using the single-page version of the app.

```mermaid

    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa <br/> Request payload: {content: "12", date: "2023-06-27...}
    activate server
    server-->>browser:  response status code "201 Created"
    deactivate server

     
    Note right of browser: default form behavior prevented  by preventDefault(), rerender didn't occur. <br/> Local array of notes was mutated. Dom tree changes due to redrawNotes()
